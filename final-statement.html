<h1>Personal Essay</h1>
    
<p>  For my final website I decided to create a personal portfolio.  It consits of five pages; a home page, my resume, contact page, a bio, and an SJUFH page.  It is a very simple website, but has all the basic requirements.  I orignally wanted to do a more fun website with a different topic but under time circumstances and my basic knowledge of HTML I decided just to create a portfolio.

    <p> On all of the pages minus my resume all the pages look the same.  I picked simple colors to use, blue, white, black, and grey.  Since it is a portfolio I did not want to have any really bright color,obnoxious colors.  For the backgroud, I chose a simple image I imported from http://subtlepatterns.com/. I also got a naviagation bar from Bootstrap that leads to all five pages.

   My home page is titled as my portfolio and  I also added a picture of Saint Joseph's University.  My resume page is very plain and simple; I chose a blue background color bordered by a neutral color.  The font is navy blue, and large so it is easy to read. On the contact page I imported icons from Fontawesome that go with email, phone, twitter and instagram.  On my bio page I added a picture of myself and a brief introduction of myself.  The last page was the SJUFH page.  I decided to add this because field hockey was always a big part of my life and it shows how I can manage my work and work well with others.

    I have learned a this semester in this class, but I did face some challenges while creating my website.  I orginally had wanted my website to look diferently, similar to the prototypes I submitted earlier, but I stuggeld with doing so.  Generally I had a difficult time with styling, such as adding the nav bar to every page.  At first I only had it on the home page and I just reccently figured out how to add it to all five pages.  I obviously wanted my site to look really cool, but realistically I am not that great at HTML.  Even though my webiste is pretty plain and simple I though I did a good job of putting what I learned to use.  p.s. thanks for a great semester and all your help, I really enjoyed this class!
